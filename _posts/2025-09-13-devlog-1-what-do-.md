I be curious. I stumbled upon this Database Systems course on YouTube by [CMU](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYDBpQnSymaectKjxCy6BYq&si=jjq_4mZlw6nFW9zB){:target="_blank"}.
I took one Database Course but the knowledge has basically evaporated from my brain.

And I want to learn Rust as well. (been doing [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} for fun, would recommend checking it out)

I guess we will be reading up on some Database Systems books and some content, and once we have some basics sorted, we will make something.
