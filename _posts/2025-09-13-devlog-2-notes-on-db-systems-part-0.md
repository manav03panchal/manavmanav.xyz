We already know what a DBMS is. The primary goal of which is to provide a way to store and retrieve DB information that is both convenient and efficient.

Underlying the structure of a database is a **data model**. It is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.
They can be classified into four diff categories:
> Relational Model

> Entity-Relationship Model

> Semi-structured Data Model

> Object-based Data Model
