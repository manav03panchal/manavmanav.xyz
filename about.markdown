I'm Manav.

CS undergrad. I like building things and understanding how they work under the hood.

Currently interested in:
- Systems programming
- Databases
- Design patterns

I write here occasionally to organize my thoughts and document what I learn.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/manav03panchal).
